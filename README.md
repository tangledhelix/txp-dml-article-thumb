**txp:dml\_article\_thumb**

This plugin provides a function similar to `<txp:article_image />`,
except it returns a thumbnail. I use it in excerpts for RSS, but
it should work anywhere. Make sure your article has an article image
ID (see the Advanced area in the write tab), then use:

	<txp:dml_article_thumb />
